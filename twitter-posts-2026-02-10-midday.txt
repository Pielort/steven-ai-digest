🛠️ Enterprise Platform Evolution

n8n, Zapier, and Make have evolved from simple automation to sophisticated multi-agent orchestration:

• n8n: Complete control + self-hosting
• Zapier: 7,000+ app integrations
• Make: Visual complex logic handling

Clear framework specialization: LangGraph vs CrewAI vs AutoGen.
