Gemini Deep Think is moving from contest math to research: DeepMind’s “Aletheia” loop generates, verifies, revises, and can admit failure. The edge is shifting from eloquence to verifiable work output. Thesis: verification becomes the moat.

Alibaba positions Qwen 3.5 for the agentic era: claimed 60% cheaper + 8x more capable on large workloads vs prior version, with “visual agentic” app control. If true, agent automation expands from boutique to high-volume ops. Unit economics wins.

Harvard/WS lens: frontier AI is bifurcating into (1) research-grade reasoning with verifiers, and (2) execution-grade agents with cost curves. Winners build stacks that maximize verified outputs per dollar, not tokens per second.

Post 4:
Action for builders: treat “thinking” like CI/CD. Build pipelines: retrieval → tool checks → refutation prompts → graded outputs → human review only when uncertainty spikes. That’s how you scale agents without scaling risk.

Post 5:
Today’s signal: AI is becoming a research+execution system. Deep Think pushes proof-grade work; Qwen 3.5 pushes agentic cost efficiency. Implication: verification + workflow integration beats standalone model hype. #AI #Agents
