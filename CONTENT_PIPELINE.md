# StevenAiDigest production rules

## Freshness
- Default: items must be published or materially updated in the last **7 days**.
- Exception: up to **2 to 3 weeks** only if it is still market relevant and the update is evergreen.
- If older than 3 weeks: do not use.

## Output constraints
- Max **4 items per day** by default.
- Each item must be written as: thesis, evidence, implication, action.
- No engagement farming.
- X copy rule: **no dash punctuation** in post wording.

## X posting QA (mandatory)
Before clicking Post or Schedule:
- Read the full post top to bottom in the composer.
- Confirm no duplicated fragments or truncated words.
- Confirm links are correct and clickable:
  - Memo link points to the exact item anchor.
  - Source links are primary where possible.
- Confirm tone: memo style, no hype.
- Confirm punctuation: no dashes.

## Sourcing
- Prefer primary sources: vendor release notes, official docs, papers, benchmark reports, regulatory filings.
- Secondary sources allowed only to provide context, never as the sole support.
- Every edition item must include 2 to 5 source links.

## Visuals (rotate, match newsletter)
- A: Wall Street chart slide (branded, restrained).
