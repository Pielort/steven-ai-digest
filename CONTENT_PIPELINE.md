## Output constraints
- Max **4 items per day**.
- Each item must be written as: thesis, evidence, implication, action.
- No engagement farming.
- X copy rule: **no dash punctuation** in post wording.

## Sourcing
- Prefer primary sources: vendor release notes, official docs, papers, benchmark reports, regulatory filings.
- Secondary sources allowed only to provide context, never as the sole support.
- Every edition item must include 2 to 5 source links.

## Visuals (rotate, match newsletter)
