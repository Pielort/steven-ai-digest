#### The AI Fragmentation-Convergence Paradox
As AI capabilities become more democratized and accessible (convergence), nations and corporations are simultaneously creating proprietary, sovereign systems (fragmentation), leading to both fragmentation (different AI ecosystems) and convergence (similar capabilities across ecosystems).
