      <h2 class="h3">Executive take</h2>
      <p>
        AI is undergoing a dual transformation—mastering both human psychology through personality assessment breakthroughs and professional workflows through intense coding model competition, creating unprecedented human-AI collaboration capabilities. 
        The simultaneous advances in psychological assessment and professional automation create what I call the "AI Collaboration Paradox"—as AI becomes better at understanding human psychology, it also becomes more capable of replacing human professional work, forcing a redefinition of human-AI partnership boundaries.
