        <h2>AI Enters the Research+Execution Era: Proof-Grade Reasoning Meets Agentic Cost Curves</h2>

        <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> The frontier is shifting from “chat that sounds smart” to systems that <em>produce verifiable work</em>. Google DeepMind’s Gemini Deep Think research agent (Aletheia) is pushing into publishable, research-level math and cross-disciplinary problem solving, while Alibaba positions Qwen 3.5 as an agentic model optimized for executing complex tasks at materially lower cost. The emerging operator edge is <strong>verification + execution</strong>, not eloquence.</p>

        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>DeepMind (Feb 11, 2026):</strong> Gemini Deep Think is being applied to professional research problems; DeepMind describes a math research agent (“Aletheia”) that iteratively generates, verifies, and revises solutions and can admit failure (improving researcher efficiency). DeepMind reports the system reaches up to ~90% on IMO-ProofBench Advanced as inference-time compute scales and cites papers + arXiv work enabled by varying degrees of autonomy. (<a href="https://deepmind.google/blog/accelerating-mathematical-and-scientific-discovery-with-gemini-deep-think/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DeepMind blog</a>)</li>
          <li><strong>Alibaba / Qwen 3.5 (reported Feb 16, 2026):</strong> Alibaba frames Qwen 3.5 for “agentic AI,” claiming it is ~60% cheaper and ~8x more capable at processing large workloads than the prior version, with “visual agentic capabilities” to operate across mobile/desktop apps. (<a href="https://www.indexbox.io/blog/alibaba-unveils-qwen-35-ai-model-for-the-agentic-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IndexBox summary of Reuters</a>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Implication:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Research becomes a pipeline:</strong> “Advisor + verifier” loops (generate → check → revise) are becoming the default way to use frontier models for hard problems. This compresses time-to-proof, time-to-literature synthesis, and time-to-experiment design.</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise agents move from demo to unit economics:</strong> Cost-per-task matters more than cost-per-token. If Qwen’s claimed efficiency holds in real deployments, agentic automation expands from “high-value, low-volume” workflows to “high-volume, boring work.”</li>
          <li><strong>Verification is the moat:</strong> The best stacks will be those that can <em>prove</em> correctness (or detect uncertainty) and route work accordingly (human review, tool-based checking, or multi-model consensus).</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Standardize a “research loop” playbook: retrieval + tool-based checks + explicit refutation prompts + versioned artifacts. Treat it like CI/CD for thinking.</li>
          <li><strong>Builders:</strong> Add verifiers (symbolic checks, unit tests, graders) as first-class components; measure success as <em>verified outputs per dollar</em>, not subjective quality.</li>
          <li><strong>Investors:</strong> Re-rate teams that own verification workflows, data + eval infrastructure, and distribution into enterprise systems; model advantage alone is becoming transient.</li>
        </ul>

Gemini Deep Think is moving from contest math to research: DeepMind’s “Aletheia” loop generates, verifies, revises, and can admit failure. The edge is shifting from eloquence to verifiable work output. Thesis: verification becomes the moat.</p></div>
          <div class="twitter-post"><p><strong>Post 2</strong>
Alibaba positions Qwen 3.5 for the agentic era: claimed 60% cheaper + 8x more capable on large workloads vs prior version, with “visual agentic” app control. If true, agent automation expands from boutique to high-volume ops. Unit economics wins.</p></div>
          <div class="twitter-post"><p><strong>Post 3</strong>
Harvard/WS lens: frontier AI is bifurcating into (1) research-grade reasoning with verifiers, and (2) execution-grade agents with cost curves. Winners build stacks that maximize verified outputs per dollar, not tokens per second.</p></div>
          <div class="twitter-post"><p><strong>Post 4</strong>
Action for builders: treat “thinking” like CI/CD. Build pipelines: retrieval → tool checks → refutation prompts → graded outputs → human review only when uncertainty spikes. That’s how you scale agents without scaling risk.</p></div>
          <div class="twitter-post"><p><strong>Post 5</strong>
Today’s signal: AI is becoming a research+execution system. Deep Think pushes proof-grade work; Qwen 3.5 pushes agentic cost efficiency. Implication: verification + workflow integration beats standalone model hype. #AI #Agents</p></div>
