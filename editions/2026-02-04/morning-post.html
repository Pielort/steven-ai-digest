      <h2 class="h3">Executive take</h2>
      <p>
        Two tectonic shifts emerged overnight.
        First, AI is moving from general capability to vertical disruption, with Anthropic's legal plugin triggering a market meltdown in legal tech.
        Second, the efficiency frontier is being redefined by sparse MoE architectures that deliver large-model performance at small-model costs.
        The race is no longer about raw capability—it's about precision targeting and economic efficiency.

      <h2 class="h3">Item 1: Anthropic's Claude Legal Plugin triggers market meltdown, signaling AI's vertical disruption phase</h2>
      <p class="muted"><b>Thesis:</b> AI's next phase is vertical disruption, not horizontal capability. When models target specific high-value workflows, they trigger immediate market revaluation.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Evidence:</b> Anthropic unveiled a legal plugin for Claude on February 3, 2026, designed for document review, compliance tracking, and legal task automation.
        Within hours, legal software stocks (LegalZoom, Thomson Reuters, RELX) dropped 5-15% as investors priced in disruption to billable-hour economics.
        The plugin represents a shift from general-purpose chatbots to workflow-specific tools that directly threaten incumbent software margins.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Implication:</b> Every vertical with high labor costs and standardized workflows is now vulnerable.
        Legal is the first domino; accounting, consulting, and regulatory compliance will follow.
        The market will punish incumbents that lack AI-native defenses and reward vertical AI specialists.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Map your industry's high-margin workflows and assess AI disruption risk.
        If you're an incumbent, build or acquire vertical AI capabilities now.
        If you're an investor, short legacy software and long vertical AI startups.
        If you're a developer, specialize in one high-value workflow rather than building general tools.
      </p>

      <h2 class="h3">Item 2: Qwen3-Coder-Next redefines the efficiency frontier with sparse MoE architecture</h2>
      <p class="muted"><b>Thesis:</b> The next performance leap comes from architectural efficiency, not parameter count. Sparse Mixture-of-Experts enables large-model capability at small-model cost.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Evidence:</b> Qwen team released Qwen3-Coder-Next on February 3, 2026—an 80B parameter model with only 3B active parameters per token.
        Using a sparse MoE architecture with hybrid attention (Gated DeltaNet + Gated Attention), it achieves SWE-Bench scores competitive with models 10-20× larger.
        The Apache 2.0 licensed model is optimized for coding agents, with agentic training on 800K executable tasks and reinforcement learning for tool calling and error recovery.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Implication:</b> Inference economics will dominate model selection.
        Teams will choose architectures based on cost-per-token, not leaderboard position.
        The open-weight advantage accelerates as efficient architectures reduce deployment barriers.
        Specialized models for coding, legal, medical, and scientific workflows will proliferate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Action:</b> Audit your inference stack for architectural efficiency.
        Test sparse MoE models against your workloads and measure real cost-per-token.
        If you're training models, prioritize MoE architectures over dense scaling.
        If you're deploying, build modular systems that can swap models as more efficient architectures emerge.
      </p>
